EC Event Consumer

EP Event Producer

REST Representational State Transfer

# Introduction

This document describes a REST API that allows Event Consumers (EC) such
as a vO-DU or CNF to subscribe to events/status from the O-Cloud. The
cloud infrastructure will provide Event Producers (EP) to enable cloud
workloads to receive events/status that might be known only to the
infrastructure.

An EC will use the REST API to subscribe to specific event types or
categories of events by specifying the event / status producer address.
The addressing scheme is covered in [Resource
Addressing](#51w7kj7rf0x8). An EC will be able to unsubscribe from
receiving events and status by deleting the subscription through the
REST API. The REST API is an integration point to an event and status
framework that is running in the underlying O-Cloud (IMS and/or DMS).

The REST API and associated event framework implementation is intended
to be used in situations where the path from event detection to event
consumption must have the lowest possible latency. Intra-node delivery
of events is a primary focus with inter-node delivery also supported.

The event framework described here is not intended to be an island of
communication and should interact with north-bound interfaces such as O2
through the IMS. Hence, this Event Consumers API is not intended to
replace O2ims notifications (including PTP loss of sync), but rather to
complement it. Please see the CAD \[6\] for more information.

Interfacing with external entities is necessary for communication with
orchestrating entities and for permanent storage of event information
for root-cause analysis. Communication with external entities is
intended to be in one direction with events flowing from this framework
outward. The flow of events from this framework to external entities
must not affect the latency performance of the framework for intra-node
or inter-node delivery.

Please note that while this API document describes an interface to
general events and status provided by the cloud infrastructure, the
discussions and examples in this document will focus on events and
status related to PTP / Synchronization as it this is the first defined
use case that affects the vO-DU per the CUSP \[5\] requirements.

*"If an O-DU transits to the FREERUN state, the O-DU shall disable RF
transmission on all connected O-RUs, and keep it turned off until
synchronization is reacquired."*

*"Whether in 'synchronized' or 'Holdover' state, it is expected that
O-DU monitors the 'SYNCED/HOLDOVER' status of the O-RUs under its
management."*

Please note that the timing requirements for notification regarding
FREERUN should follow WG4 guidelines when available in the CUSP
document. These guidelines may influence the future evolution and design
of this API. Please see the CUSP \[5\] for more information.

Subscription/Publication use case:

- Subscription by the Event Consumer (e.g. vO-DU or other CNF) triggers
  the readiness of the Event Consumer to receive the notifications.

- The REST API handler implementation, provided by the Cloud
  infrastructure, resides in the application (workload) and is an
  application appropriate implementation of a REST API handler.

- Upon subscription, the EC will receive an initial notification of the
  EP resource status. For example, the current synchronization status of
  the PTP system will be sent to the EC when subscribing to the
  sync-status address. Or as another example, the current interface
  carrier status will be sent to the EC when subscribing to the
  interface-status address. This initial notification allows the joining
  application to synchronize to the current status of the system being
  observed.

- Event Consumers will be able to subscribe to resource status
  notifications offered by the cloud.

- Multiple Event Consumers in the same container, Pod, or VM can
  subscribe to events and status as the REST API allows multiple receive
  endpoint URI.

- If the eventing framework cannot provide the requested subscription
  the eventing framework will deny the subscription request and Event
  Consumer (vO-DU, vO-CU etc) will be able to make a decision if to
  proceed with its operation

### Content type

JSON, IETF RFC 8259 shall be used as content type of the HTTP bodies
specified in the present specification.The use of the JSON format shall
be signaled by the content type \"application/json\".

\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional
details of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by
the content type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in
IETF RFC 7807.

### Resource addressing

The format of the resource address is shown in [[Table
1]{.underline}](#table1). The resource address specifies the Event
Producer with a hierarchical path. The path format provides the ability
for management and monitoring to extend beyond a single cluster and
node.

[]{#table1 .anchor}**Table 1: Resource address format**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   /{clusterName}/{siteName}(/optional/hierarchy/..)/{nodeName}/{(/optional/hierarchy)/resource}

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example hierarchy could include an IMS and DMS designator i.e.,
**/ims-1/dms-2/node1/*sync/sync-status/sync-state***. The event
framework is minimally required to support nodeName addressing. The
event framework addressing nomenclature for nodeName shall match the
O-Cloud technology naming scheme.

This hierarchy path is part of the environment variables provided to the
CNF by the Downward API (see
[[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/#the-downward-api]{.underline}](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/#the-downward-api))

# Authentication and Security

## Overview

The O-Cloud Notification API supports two complementary authentication mechanisms to ensure secure communication between Event Consumers and Event Producers:

1. **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: Certificate-based authentication at the transport layer
2. **OAuth 2.0**: Token-based authentication at the application layer

These authentication mechanisms can be used independently or in combination (dual authentication) depending on the deployment security requirements.

## Authentication Mechanisms

### mTLS (Mutual TLS) Authentication

mTLS provides transport layer security by requiring both the client and server to authenticate using X.509 certificates.

**Key Features:**
- Certificate-based client authentication
- Encrypted communication channel
- Certificate verification against trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
- Support for OpenShift Service CA for automatic certificate management

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Client must present valid X.509 certificate signed by trusted CA
- Server verifies client certificate during TLS handshake
- Certificate Subject Name and validity period are validated
- Certificate revocation checking may be implemented

**Error Responses:**
- **401 Unauthorized**: Client certificate not provided or invalid
- **403 Forbidden**: Valid certificate but insufficient permissions

### OAuth 2.0 Authentication

OAuth 2.0 provides application layer authentication using Bearer tokens (JWT - JSON Web Tokens).

**Supported Token Types:**
1. **OpenShift OAuth Tokens**: Issued by OpenShift OAuth server
2. **Kubernetes ServiceAccount Tokens**: Native Kubernetes authentication tokens

**Token Validation:**
- **Issuer Verification**: Token must be issued by trusted OAuth server
- **Audience Validation**: Token audience must match the API service
- **Signature Verification**: Token signature verified using JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)
- **Expiration Check**: Token must not be expired
- **Scope Validation**: Token must contain required scopes (if configured)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Client includes Bearer token in Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Server validates token against OpenShift OAuth server or Kubernetes API
- Token introspection performed on each API request
- Failed validation results in 401 Unauthorized response

**Error Responses:**
- **401 Unauthorized**: Token missing, invalid, expired, or failed validation
- **403 Forbidden**: Valid token but insufficient permissions

### Dual Authentication

When both mTLS and OAuth are enabled, clients must satisfy both authentication mechanisms:

1. **TLS Layer**: Client certificate verified during TLS handshake
2. **Application Layer**: Bearer token validated in Authorization header

**Benefits of Dual Authentication:**
- Defense-in-depth security model
- Compliance with security standards requiring multiple authentication factors
- Protection against compromised credentials (either certificate or token)

## Authentication Requirements by Endpoint

The following table describes authentication requirements for each API endpoint:

**Table: Authentication Requirements by HTTP Method**

+---------------------------+---------------+------------------+-------------------------+
| **Endpoint**              | **Method**    | **Auth Required**| **Description**         |

**Note**: Localhost connections (within the same POD/VM) may bypass authentication requirements depending on deployment configuration.

## Security Considerations

### Certificate Management

**For mTLS Authentication:**
- Certificates should be rotated regularly (recommended: 90 days or less)
- Use strong key sizes (minimum RSA 2048-bit or ECDSA P-256)
- Implement certificate revocation checking (CRL or OCSP)
- Store private keys securely (encrypted, restricted access)

**OpenShift Service CA Integration:**
- Automatic certificate issuance and rotation
- Certificates mounted as Kubernetes Secrets
- Trust bundle distributed via ConfigMaps

### Token Management

**For OAuth 2.0 Authentication:**
- Tokens should have limited lifetime (recommended: 1 hour or less)
- Use refresh tokens for long-running clients
- Implement token revocation support
- Protect tokens in transit (HTTPS only)
- Validate all token claims (issuer, audience, expiration)

### Localhost Exception

Connections originating from localhost (127.0.0.1 or ::1) may bypass authentication:
- **Rationale**: Helper/Sidecar containers in same POD/VM are trusted
- **Risk**: Compromise of any container in POD grants API access
- **Mitigation**: Use RBAC and Pod Security Policies to limit container capabilities

### RBAC Integration

When using Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens:
- Token subject mapped to Kubernetes ServiceAccount
- RBAC policies control access to API operations
- Principle of least privilege: Grant minimal required permissions
- Use separate ServiceAccounts for different workload types

## Configuration Examples

### mTLS Configuration

**Client Certificate Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api-server:9043/api/ocloudNotifications/v2/subscriptions \
  --cert /etc/certs/client.crt \
  --key /etc/certs/client.key \
  --cacert /etc/certs/ca.crt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ResourceAddress": "/sync/sync-status/sync-state", "EndpointUri": "http://localhost:8080/callback"}'
```

### OAuth 2.0 Configuration

**Bearer Token Request:**
```bash
TOKEN=$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)
curl -X POST https://api-server:9043/api/ocloudNotifications/v2/subscriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ResourceAddress": "/sync/sync-status/sync-state", "EndpointUri": "http://localhost:8080/callback"}'
```

### Dual Authentication Configuration

**mTLS + OAuth Request:**
```bash
TOKEN=$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)
curl -X POST https://api-server:9043/api/ocloudNotifications/v2/subscriptions \
  --cert /etc/certs/client.crt \
  --key /etc/certs/client.key \
  --cacert /etc/certs/ca.crt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ResourceAddress": "/sync/sync-status/sync-state", "EndpointUri": "http://localhost:8080/callback"}'
```

### Resources and HTTP Methods

An Event Consumer (e.g. vDU or other CNF) will use a POST request to
subscribe to receive notifications per its desirable resource. This
resource is mapped to a data type/payload (see data model).

The POST's payload will also include the notification endpoint (callback
URI) for the API Producer to send the notifications back to the EC.

The API Producer, in this case the Helper (see appendix A), will
validate that the resource requested is offered by the cluster and
available at the particular address. If the resource does not exist an
error code will be sent to the client's EndpointURI. This will be
followed by a sanity check of the requested notification endpoint and
creating the resource if communication to the notification endpoint is
successful. To reduce security concerns and lifecycle management burden
the notification endpoint URI must be part of the same localhost, this
is the localhost shared by the Event Consumer and Helper, with the
assumption that they are located in the same POD or VM.

###  Subscription resource definition

The resource URI is:

**{apiRoot}/ocloudNotifications/{apiMajorVersion}/subscriptions**

The resource URI variables supported by the resource shall be defined as
[Table 4](#table4) illustrates.

[]{#table4 .anchor} **Table 4: Resource URI variables for this
resource**

  ----------------- ------------------------------------------------------
      **Name**                          **Definition**

       apiRoot           described in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 

   apiMajorVersion                            v2
  ----------------- ------------------------------------------------------

#### Subscription POST Method

The POST method creates a subscription resource for the Event Consumer.
As the result of successfully executing this method, a new subscription
resource shall exist as defined in clause 1.2, and a variable value
(*subscriptionId*) will be used in the representation of that resource.
An initial status notification for the type of event (for example, PTP
synchronization status) shall be triggered. The status describes the
initial status of the producer resource when successfully executing this
method as defined in clause 1.1.4, followed by any PTP status
notifications (triggered if there is a change in PTP status).

URI query parameters supported by the method shall be defined as [Table
5](#table5) illustrates.

# Status Notifications API Definition

## Description

After a successful subscription (a subscription resource was created)
the Event Consumer (e.g. vO-DU or other CNF) shall be able to receive
event notifications from the subscribed resource.

Events are sent by the Event Framework when a change of resource state
occurs. The significance of the change of state is dependent upon the
Event Producer service. An example for the PTP use case might be that a
**synchronization-state-change** has occurred, i.e. FREERUN-\>LOCKED or
LOCKED-\>HOLDOVER.

The HTTP method for delivering the notification (push) to the EC shall
be POST and the notification shall be sent to the endpoint reference
provided by the EC client during the creation of the subscription
resource (see [Table 17](#mvrsb9imzfm) The payload body of the POST
request shall contain the event payload (see event data model).

[[Figure 3]{.underline}](#figure3) illustrates an intra-node (local
notification) event delivery. In this example, the following occurs:

1.  The Event Framework determines that an event condition has occurred

2.  The Event Consumer (vO-DU etc) has previously subscribed to the
    event type and the API Producer performs a POST to the EV (vO-DU
    etc) with the complete JSON event payload

### Event Consumer Notification Resource Definition

The EC's endpoint URI is used by the API Producer (Helper) to deliver
events to the Event Consumer (e.g. vO-DU or CNF).

The EC's Endpoint URI^2^ is:

**http://localhost:{port}/{path}**

The resource URI variables supported by the resource shall be defined as
[Table 18](#table18) illustrates.

[]{#table18 .anchor}**Table 18 Resource URI variables for this
resource**

  ---------- ------------------------------------------------------------
   **Name**                         **Definition**

     Port      The port of the endpoint URI provided by the subscriber

     Path      The path of the endpoint URI provided by the subscriber
  ---------- ------------------------------------------------------------

#### Consumer Notification Delivery Method

The HTTP method for the notification that corresponds to an explicit
subscription shall be POST and the notification shall be sent to the
endpoint reference provided during the creation of the subscription
resource. The payload body of the POST request shall contain the event
notification payload (see event data model).

URI query parameters supported by the method shall be defined as [Table
19](#table19) illustrates.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

^2^Note: To reduce security concerns and lifecycle management burden the
endpoint URI must be part of the same localhost, this is the localhost
shared by the EC and API Producer in a POD or VM.

#### Notification Sanity Check Method

The Event Consumer POST request to create a subscription resource will
trigger the initial delivery of producer status of the resource that
will be sent to the endpoint URI provided by Event Consumer. The purpose
is to confirm that the endpoint URI is valid and to send the initial
status for the resource. If the validation fails, the subscription for
the resource will not be created.

# Event Pull Status Notifications API Definition

## Description

In addition to receiving event status notifications the Event Consumer
(e.g. vO-DU or CNF) shall be able to pull event status notifications.
This status notifications will be limited only to the node that the
vO-DU resides on.

[Figure 5](#figure5) illustrates event pull status notifications and
[Table 25](#table25) describes resources and methods.

#### Event Pull Status Notification GET Method

The GET method combined with the *ResourceAddress* variable pulls the
event status notifications. As a result of successful execution of this
method the Event Consumer will receive the current event status
notifications of the node that the Event Consumer resides on.

URI query parameters supported by the method shall be defined as [Table

**Editor's note:** Currently the pull status operator returns the PTP
Sync State event as defined in [[PTP
Sync-State]{.underline}](#_9s5i4y3v6j4g). In future versions of this
specification, status information can be expanded to other metrics /
information pertinent to the operation of the system.

### Synchronization Event Specifications

The following sections define the events related to synchronization
events.

Editor\'s Note: synchronization state change events are addressed first
due to priority of the RAN use cases, the event distribution
infrastructure and associated interfaces are not limited to one specific
event category, and events from other subsystems will be added in the
future versions of this document.

Editor\'s Note: the present event set is aligned with / based on the
WG4/WG5 YANG models; however, use of some other definitions such as
composite clock modes in G.8275 (10/2020), Appendix VIII (or composite
of the two approaches) \*may\* be more useful to convey the information
in detail required to adequately specify the states in the cloud nodes
context.

#### Synchronization State

This notification abstracts the underlying technology that the node is
using to synchronize itself. It provides the overall synchronization
health of the node. This notification includes the health of the OS
System Clock which is consumable by application(s).

### Helper/Sidecar containers

Reference:
[[https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/06/the-distributed-system-toolkit-patterns/]{.underline}](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/06/the-distributed-system-toolkit-patterns/)

Helper/Sidecar containers extend and enhance the \"main\" container,
they take existing containers and make them better.  

As an example, consider a container that runs the Nginx web server.  Add
a different container that syncs the file system with a git repository,
share the file system between the containers and one has built built Git
push-to-deploy. And it has been done in a modular manner where the git
synchronizer can be built by a different team, and can be reused across
many different web servers (Apache, Python, Tomcat, etc).  Because of
this modularity, the git synchronizer may be written and tested only
once and reused across numerous apps.

### Helper/Sidecar value:

- Interacts with the notification framework on behalf of the vO-DU

- Decouples the app logic from the notification framework, hence removes
  the burden of implementing a lot of code on the vO-DU and maintaining
  this code

- Single secure and reliable API endpoint since it is exposed over the
  localhost

- Eliminating the discovery of an external pod implementation
